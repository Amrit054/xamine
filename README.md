# Xamine
Doing exercises in the right posture is an important aspect of it. If the posture is incorrect, all the efforts to have a well strengthened physique go in vain. It may even cause injury or have a negative effect on your body. Doing exercises not only makes your body fit but also improves your mental health. We propose out system Xamine that will help the user at home do their exercises in a right posture. It will be a good alternative to both the personal trainer that can be hard to get and not cost efficient and the gym exercise apps that just tells users how to do the exercise but not help them evaluate or correct it.
